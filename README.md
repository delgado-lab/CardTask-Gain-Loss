File Descriptions

CardTaskRP_Speer2014_displayupdatedA and CardTaskRP_Speer2014_displayupdatedB

_Experimental Design_ 2 conditions (Reward, Punishment) within subjects

_Timing Information_

Structured for one 9min 20s scan (does not include practice trials)

Event Timing (each trial) -

1. Input guess 2s
2. Inter-stimulus-interval 24s (50%50%)
3. Outcome RewardPunishment (50%50%), or &quot;no response&quot; on missed response trials
4. Inter-trial interval 68s (50%50%)

_Trial Counts and other details_

3 practice trials at beginning (skip by setting weight to zero in &quot;practice&quot; list)

40 experimental trials, 2 pseudorandom orders (_displayupdatedA and _displayupdatedB)

Keyboard input accepts &quot;1&quot; or &quot;b&quot; for &quot;lower&quot; guess, &quot;2&quot; or &quot;y&quot; for &quot;higher&quot; guess. Initial screens accept &quot;t&quot; to advance. &quot;trigger&quot; expects &quot;t&quot; to begin experiment.

_How to interpret fields in output files_

&quot;wait8.OnsetTime&quot; stores clocktime of experiment start time (8s blank screen starts at this time)

&quot;input.Resp&quot; stores response for each experimental trial (low=&quot;1&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, high=&quot;2&quot; or &quot;y&quot;). Empty if no response

&quot;input.RT&quot; stores response time for each trial. 0 if no response.

&quot;procedure&quot; stores trial condition (rewardpunishment)
